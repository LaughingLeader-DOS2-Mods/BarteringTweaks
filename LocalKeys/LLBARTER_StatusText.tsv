LLBARTER_Mod_Description	Shares the highest barter and persuasion bonuses among the party while trading. Additionally, BT contains additional quality-of-life tweaks, such as auto-sneaking chained party members when sneaking/unsneaking. If LeaderLib is active, the Bartering Tweaks settings menu is available from the mod menu, otherwise a settings book will be added to the party&apos;s inventory.
