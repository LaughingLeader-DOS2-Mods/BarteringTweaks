=======

Bartering Tweaks is a quality-of-life mod that shares the highest barter and persuasion bonuses among the party while trading.
Additionally, Bartering Tweaks contains additional tweaks, such as auto-sneaking chained party members when sneaking. 

**Be sure to grab the latest [LeaderLib](https://github.com/LaughingLeader-DOS2-Mods/LeaderLib/releases/tag/mod-releases) release to enable the settings menu (available from the mod menu).**

# Features:
* The highest Bartering and Persuasion abilities in the party are shared among user-controlled characters when trading.
* Attitude sharing can be enabled in the settings menu, allowing you to share your attitude bonuses when trading.
* When sneaking or unsneaking, chained party members sneak/unsneak as well.
* A Pet Pal Talent Book is sold at the [LeaderLib](https://github.com/LaughingLeader-DOS2-Mods/LeaderLib/releases/tag/mod-releases) trader, granting the Pet Pal talent for a small price.
