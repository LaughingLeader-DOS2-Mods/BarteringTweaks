Bartering Tweaks Changelog
=======
# 1.0.1.1
* Added a missing localization string (Stats_LLBARTER_PersuasionBonus => Party Persuasion).
* Added a safety check for clearing Persuasion bonuses from other owned characters when dialog ends. Note that your persuasion bonuses will apply to all owned characters while one of them is in dialog - this is intended, since you may decide to switch characters and start up another dialog.

# 1.0.1.0
* Added persuasion sharing in dialog & trade, enabled in the Features sub-menu.
* Added a "Remove All Bonuses" debug command for hosts. It removes every shared persuasion/bartering/attitude bonus on all players.

# 1.0.0.7
* Reworked attitude-sharing so it applies to all user-owned characters. Still a little experimental.

# 1.0.0.5
* Initial Release
